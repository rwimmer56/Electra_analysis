# Electra analysis

## 1. Obtaining necessary datasets
Since we are working with three different datasets it is necessary to obtain them beforehand.

* SQUAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar, et al.,2018) dataset can be obtained here:
  * [Training set](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/train-v2.0.json)
  * [Dev set](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v2.0.json)
 
* QUaC (Choi, et al.,2018) dataset can be obtained here:
  * [Training set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/my89public/quac/train_v0.2.json)
  * [Dev set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/my89public/quac/val_v0.2.json)

* NewsQA (Trischler, et al.,2016) - to obtain the original dataset [NewsQA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09830) was built on, it is necessary to follow the provided guide that can be found here:
  * [NewsQA set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/my89public/quac/train_v0.2.json)
 
* NewsQA - MRQA variant dataset can be obtained here (Fisch, et al.,2019):
  * [Training set](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mrqa/release/v2/train/NewsQA.jsonl.gz)
  * [Dev set](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mrqa/release/v2/dev/NewsQA.jsonl.gz)

## 2. Transforming datasets

In order to work with the aforementioned datasets it is necessary to convert some of them to a format ELECTRA's basic tools can handle.  
  
The necessary tools can be found in the [dataset_converter folder](https://github.com/TheHaymitch/Electra_analysis/tree/main/dataset_converter), which contains modified repository/code created by Priyanka Sen and Amir Saffari (2020). Follow the guide inside the folder to obtain necessary converted datasets.  

 ## 3. Using Electra
 In the [electra folder](https://github.com/TheHaymitch/Electra_analysis/tree/main/electra) you can find detailed guide how to use ELECTRA. This folder contains modified repository/code from the published research by Clark, et al. (2020). Sucessful fine-tuning + evaluation will result in creation of a folder containing necessary files for error analysis.
