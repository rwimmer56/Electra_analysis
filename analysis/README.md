Each of the dataset-specifc directories contains two files
* `<NAME_OF_THE_DATASET>_create_files.ipynb` which should be used first. Here every file necessary for the error analysis is being created. 
Before running the code, it is required to change the paths to the required files based on their locations on your machine. 
  
* `<NAME_OF_THE_DATASET>_error_analysis.ipynb` used for coplete analysis of the predictions & datasets.
  
Since QUaC dataset is rather specific due to its converational task, the necessary changes will be discussed in the QUaC directory.
